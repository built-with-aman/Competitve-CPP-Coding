// unordered_set: This code demonstrates the use of an unordered set in C++.
// An unordered set is a container that stores unique elements in no particular order.
// It provides fast access to elements and is implemented using a hash table.
// The code includes operations such as inserting elements, checking for existence, and removing elements.
// It also shows how to iterate through the elements of the unordered set.
// all operation same but lower bound and upper bound not available in unordered set
// o(1) time complexity for insertion, deletion, and search operations
// once in blue moon o(n) time complexity for search operation
